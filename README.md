# Amazon-Clone-
To create an Amazon clone using only HTML and CSS, build a static layout that mimics Amazon's homepage. Structure the layout with HTML elements like a navigation bar, product grids, and a footer, then use CSS for styling, including responsiveness, colors, fonts, and grid/flexbox layouts to align content similar to Amazon's interface.
